# Outstanding work — current decisions

Updated 2026-09-13 against `origin/main` at `4a3c01ab`.
The original path inventory remains in [the audit summary](audits/local-worktree-summary-2026-09-13.md)
and its linked reports. Historical snapshots are not current task status.

## Merge follow-through — 2026-09-13

User explicitly authorized merging without waiting for CI. Integrated PRs
**#59 attachment checks**, **#60 sidebar drafts**, and **#63 project/conversation
import** into main as version **0.7.0**. Feature code merged cleanly; resolved
version/lockfile metadata and preserved all changelog/roadmap entries. GitHub merge
API failed with HTTP502; integration used Git merge history and a non-force push.

- [x] Integrate #59, #60 and #63 with their full branch histories.
- [x] Preserve the decision document and audit appendices in Git.
- [ ] Run combined-main full typecheck and CI; no new combined-tree validation was
      run before merge under the explicit CI waiver. Prior individual PR evidence is
      not proof of the integrated revision.
- [ ] Resolve remaining Windows/branding checks and verify the combined Nix hash.
- [ ] Build Windows client, Linux daemon and Android from the merged source.
      Publication and installed-update acceptance remain separate work.
- [ ] Verify import interrupted-transfer/corrupt-cleanup recovery and cross-machine
      behavior on actual clients. Uploaded Claude/Codex exports remain text history;
      native resume depends on supported provider sessions available to the daemon.

The existing monitor owns post-merge follow-through:
`98d9fb49-d923-409c-8062-f970c03608ed`, heartbeat `55f33684`.

## Approved and delegated

- [x] **S1 — Reject oversized attachments before reading/copying.** Approved.
      Agent `/root/stop`, branch `fix/attachment-preread-size`, worktree
      `/tmp/frogg-attachment-size-current`. Adapt shared browser/Expo and Electron paths;
      meaningful regression checks, full typecheck, PR and merge on success.
- [x] **S2 — Resume unfinished workspace drafts through the sidebar.** Approved.
      Agent `/root/install`, branch `feat/sidebar-draft-resume`, worktree
      `/tmp/frogg-sidebar-draft-resume`. Preserve current submission lifecycle and host
      navigation; regression checks, full typecheck, PR and merge on success.
      Coordinate version/integration after S1 to avoid conflicting release bumps.

- [x] **P5 — Import projects with conversations through Add project.** Approved;
      replaces the narrow CLI session-import proposal. Agent `/root/connect` owns
      implementation in a new isolated worktree. Support source directories and
      conversations on this computer or the selected daemon machine, including a
      remote daemon. Merge into an existing matching project and deduplicate sessions.
      Audit actual provider formats and resume capabilities; distinguish importing
      history from transferring code or making a provider session resumable. Client
      paths must not be treated as paths accessible to a remote daemon. Build source
      selection, discovery/preview, transfer where needed, and regression coverage.

## Follow-ups from `consolidate-ui-remove-plugins` (moved from `docs/todo.md`)

### Settings: agents

- **Remove Frogg agent profiles.** The Agents tab still has Frogg-specific agent profiles with daemon state behind them, and the composer model picker's "edit" link opens them. Providers handle agents themselves, so this duplicates them. Remove the UI, the daemon persistence and the RPCs, and keep old configs loading.
- **Remove Frogg-managed skills.** The daemon installs and reconciles skills into `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills`. Decide whether to drop this or turn it into a read-only list like agent definitions.
- **Keep the agent host settings** (Frogg tools toggle, browser tools opt-in, appended system prompt). They could move to Overview if the Agents tab ends up with little else on it.
- **Verify the provider agent folders against real installs.**
  - Codex: `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`. Confirm the folder and the TOML fields.
  - Copilot: `~/.copilot/agents/*.agent.md` and `<project>/.github/agents/`.
  - OpenCode: `agent/` versus `agents/` (both are scanned).
- **Add agent folder detection for more providers:** Cursor, Kiro, Kimi, Trae, Pi and OMP. Their folder conventions haven't been confirmed.
- **Test what's untested:** the handler for `agent.provider_definitions.list`, the agent definitions UI section, and the `providerAgentDefinitions` feature gate.
- **Make "Open in editor" work beyond desktop with a local daemon.** It needs a remote file-edit path, or can stay copy-path only.

### Settings: cleanup

- **Delete the now-unused i18n keys:** `hostSections.metadata`, `hostSections.connections` and `host.workspaces.unavailable`, in all locales.
- **Check the new layout on desktop, web and mobile.** Overview is now long with Connections, Workspaces and Metadata generation added, and nobody has looked at it in the app yet.
- **Run the settings Playwright e2e specs.** The helpers and specs were updated but not run.

### Plugin removal follow-ups

- **Remove the compat config keys** `pluginsEnabled` and `plugins` from the daemon config schema after 2027-09-13.
- **Remove the unused `allowDuringStartup` parameter** in `packages/server/src/server/websocket-server.ts`. It is always false now.
- **Handle old deep links.** `/settings/plugins` and plugin surface routes now fall through to the router's unknown-route handling. Consider redirecting them to settings.
- **Update our agent definitions.** `.claude/agents/daemon-dev.md` and `dev-tooling.md` still mention `packages/plugin` and the old build order.
- **Run e2e and a real device pass** on the plugin removal. Neither was run.

### CI and merging

- **Branding acceptance fails on every branch** (the `nix` and `desktop (macos-latest, brands/example)` jobs). Fix it or drop it so it stops hiding real failures.

## Awaiting owner decisions / explanation

- [ ] **P3 — LAN trust default and live claim-status reporting.** Main and published
      0.6.13 default `trustLan` to true. Unless a password is set, private-network clients
      are trusted without pairing. Proposed old patch makes a network listener default
      to untrusted while preserving explicit choices, and reads live trust state for
      claim status. Separate the useful reporting correction from the pairing-policy
      decision. This is distinct from Q1's listener address.
- [ ] **P2/P4 — Android in-app update prompt and signing migration.** Old prompt
      polls releases and links an APK, but hardcodes arm64 and rejects unsigned assets.
      Current distribution intentionally preserves debug-signed upgrades pending a signing
      migration. Decide prompt scope and migration together; do not copy unchanged.

## Verified complete — removed from outstanding tasks

- **R1:** draft lookup fix merged as `222a357f`; `v0.6.13` is public stable Latest,
  published 2026-09-13T06:23:38Z. The previous publication blocker is resolved.
- **Q1:** configuration/listener work merged through `e7b6589b` (including
  `b9eb2e7f` and `fb2df63c`). Main defaults new config and SSH deployment to
  `0.0.0.0:9999`, provides readable config/config-format, and lets services follow
  saved config unless explicitly overridden. Existing loopback settings remain intact.
  Published0.6.13 predates these changes; “merged” is not “installed on your host.”
- **Q2/P1:** directory browser merged as `4f292540`, included in main. Independent
  subagent verified27 directory-browser/model tests and5 server POSIX explorer tests.
  No duplicate PR needed. Current browser/device acceptance was not rerun.
- **Q3:** cancellable/retryable network discovery merged through `e7b6589b`;
  current hook exposes cancel and uses cancellation across probes. No longer pending.
- **Q4:** selected-build workflow already exists and has evolved in main. Dismiss
  the old integration task; do not remove the maintained workflow.

## Dismissed by owner — do not implement

- **P6/P7:** CLI open-agent and GitHub-clone convenience commands dismissed.

- **S3:** old virtualizer variant/review task; main already has stable callbacks.
- **D1/D2/D3:** persistent diagnostic feature, old profiling tooling, historical trace update.
- **D4/D5:** retired native-window/transport/updater experiments.
- **M1–M8:** old mobile roadmap proposals.
- **P8/P9/P10:** old CLI redesign/empty speech group, Companion removal, and
  CI/performance/config reversions.
- **C1–C3:** no further migration task for transferred patches, generated residue,
  or stashes. Dismissal does not authorize deleting user runtime state or dirty worktrees.
- **R2/R3:** remove from this migration decision list. Release source selection and
  required installation/update checks still apply when a release is requested.

## Verification boundary

“Live” above means the published stable release, not a probe of the user's running
machine. No live daemon/service was changed or inspected. `v0.6.19` was still a draft
at verification time. New approved PRs must report actual checks and merge results;
this document does not mark delegated work complete before that evidence arrives.
