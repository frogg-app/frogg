description: Add or change a WebSocket session RPC between the Frogg daemon and its clients. Use when adding a new request/response message, wiring a daemon handler, exposing a new daemon capability to the app, gating a feature on `server_info.features`, or when a protocol change fails typecheck, the authorization exhaustiveness test. Covers the exact ordered file list and the traps.

# Adding a session RPC

Thirteen steps across seven hand-edited files, in a fixed order. Skipping one usually surfaces as
a typecheck error in an unrelated package or a CI job that fails on generated artifacts, so
follow the order.

Read the protocol section of the coding standards
(`website/src/content/docs/docs/contributing/coding-standards.mdx`, published at
https://frogg.app/docs/contributing/coding-standards/) before designing the message. The rules that bite:

- Dotted names, direction last: `checkout.forge.set_auto_merge.request` / `.response`. Never add
  a new flat snake_case name.
- The operation segment is a verb. `get_noun.request`, never `noun.request`.
- Requests are flat with `cwd` and `requestId` at top level. Responses put everything under
  `payload`, including `requestId` and a nullable `error`.
- The response type must be exactly the request type with `.request` → `.response`. The client
  helper derives it by string replacement; a mismatch is unfixable without a bespoke call path.
- New fields are `.optional()`. Never flip optional to required, remove a field, or narrow a
  type — an app six months old still has to parse your message.
- Wire schemas are pure: no `.transform()`, `.catch()`, or `.preprocess()`. The outbound
  validator is compiled ahead of time and the generator only compiles pure schemas.
- `z.discriminatedUnion`, never `z.union`, when branches share a literal tag.

Use `checkout.forge.set_auto_merge.*` as the worked example; every step below has a real line
you can copy from.

## Ordered checklist

Everything in steps 1–5 is `packages/protocol/src/messages.ts`.

1. **Request schema** — in the section for your domain (checkout requests sit around line 2230).
2. **Response schema** — the matching response section (around line 5290).
3. **Inferred types** — `export type X = z.infer<typeof XSchema>` for both. The client imports
   these; without them there is no payload type to alias.
4. **`SessionInboundMessageSchema`** — add the request schema const to the discriminated union.
5. **`SessionOutboundMessageSchema`** — add the response schema const. `WSInboundMessageSchema`
   and `WSOutboundMessageSchema` wrap the session unions and need no edit.
6. **Capability flag**, if the app must gate on it — add
   `<flagName>: z.boolean().optional()` to `features` on `ServerInfoStatusPayloadSchema`, with a
   `// COMPAT(<name>): added in vX.Y.Z, remove after <date>` comment.
7. **Inbound permission** — `packages/server/src/server/authorization/operation-permissions.ts`,
   the `INBOUND_PERMISSION` record. Add the `.request` key in alphabetical order.
8. **Outbound permission** — the _second_ record in the same file, `OUTBOUND_PERMISSION`. This is
   the step agents skip. It is a separate exhaustive `Record` keyed over
   `SessionOutboundMessage["type"]`, so **every** outbound type needs a row: responses, and also
   pure server-push events (`agent_stream`, `workspace_update`, `project.update`). Permissions do
   not "key off the inbound request" — the outbound frame is authorized independently on its way
   out. Pick the same permission you gave the request. Only one key in the whole record is
   legitimately `null`: `rpc_error`, which must reach a client that is not allowed to do anything
   else. Do not add new `null` rows.
   Note the two direction-inverted pairs already in the tables — `browser.automation.execute.*`
   lives with `.response` inbound and `.request` outbound, because the daemon is the caller. If
   your message works that way, the records swap too.
9. **Handler** — the domain session file, e.g.
   `packages/server/src/server/session/checkout/checkout-session.ts`. Handlers take
   `Extract<SessionInboundMessage, { type: "ns.x.request" }>`, return `Promise<void>`, and
   **emit** the response. They never return it.
10. **Dispatch** — `packages/server/src/server/session.ts`. Add a `case` to the
    `dispatchXxxMessage` switch for your domain (`dispatchCheckoutMessage` is around line 2419).
    `dispatchInboundMessage` chains those with `??`; each switch has `default: return undefined`.
11. **Advertise the capability** — `buildServerInfoStatusPayload` in
    `packages/server/src/server/websocket-server.ts`. A flag means the running daemon can
    actually perform the action, not merely that a handler exists; conditional flags use
    `...(cond ? { flag: true } : {})`.
12. **Client method** — `packages/client/src/daemon-client.ts`: import the response type, add a
    `type XPayload = XResponse["payload"]` alias, then a public async method calling
    `this.sendNamespacedCorrelatedSessionRequest<"ns.x.response">({ requestId, message, timeout })`.
    Dotted names get response-type derivation for free here.
13. **Call site** — gate on the capability in exactly one place
    (`session?.serverInfo?.features?.<flag> === true`) and let everything downstream read a clean
    shape. No fallback path for old daemons; the user updates or does not get the feature.

Then tests: the handler test beside the handler, the dispatch-routing test in
`packages/server/src/server/session.test.ts` (which also holds a stub interface listing handler
names — add yours or the fake stops satisfying its type), and the feature-gate test beside the
call site.

## Regenerate the derived artifacts

zod is the source of truth; generated schemas and validators must agree with it.

```bash
npm run build --workspace=@frogg/protocol
npm run generate:validators --workspace=@frogg/protocol
```

Commit tracked protocol schema/fixture changes produced by the current build.
The retired Rust backend is not a production generation or release target.

The ahead-of-time outbound validator
(`packages/protocol/src/generated/validation/ws-outbound.aot.ts`) is gitignored and regenerated
by `pretypecheck`/`pretest`/`prebuild` in `@frogg/protocol`. `@frogg/client` has no such hook, so
run `npm run generate:validators --workspace=@frogg/protocol` before testing the client — a stale
validator makes the client silently reject your new response frame.

## Verify

```bash
npm run typecheck:server    # relay → protocol → client → server → cli; cheapest gate that
                            # catches missing permission keys and client type drift
npx vitest run packages/server/src/server/authorization/index.test.ts --bail=1
npx vitest run packages/server/src/server/session/checkout/checkout-session.test.ts --bail=1
npm run test --workspace=@frogg/protocol
bash scripts/ci/check-generated-rust.sh
```

The authorization test enumerates `SessionInboundMessageSchema.options` and asserts every
operation has a permission — that is the exhaustiveness gate that catches a union entry with no
permission row.

## Reading a typecheck error in `operation-permissions.ts`

Two different mistakes both land on this one file, and the error code tells them apart. Verified
by deleting and by adding a key against a current build:

- **`TS2741: Property '"x.response"' is missing in type ... but required in type 'Record<...>'`**,
  usually with a companion `TS2551` on the `OUTBOUND_PERMISSION[operation]` accessor below — you
  genuinely forgot the row. Add it (step 8).
- **`TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties`** naming your new key — the row is
  there but the union does not contain the type. Almost
  always a **stale `@frogg/protocol` build**, not a bug in your entry. `@frogg/server` typechecks
  against `packages/protocol/dist`, so a message type you added minutes ago is invisible until
  protocol is rebuilt. Run this **before** concluding anything about the entry:

  ```bash
  npm run build:protocol && npm run build:client
  ```

  If TS2353 survives a fresh build, then and only then is it a real typo in the key. See the
  stale-build trap in [skills/frogg-dev](../frogg-dev/SKILL.md) for the general shape of this failure.

The same discriminator applies to `INBOUND_PERMISSION`. Any other downstream package reporting
that a field you just added does not exist is the same stale-`dist` story: run `npm run
build:client`.

## Shims

Every back-compat shim carries `// COMPAT(name): added in vX.Y.Z, remove after <date>` at the
site that has to be deleted. `rg "COMPAT\("` is the cleanup backlog; an untagged `??` fallback
never gets removed because nobody can find it.
