# Frogg desktop development

Own `apps/desktop`; coordinate shared UI and protocol changes with their
owners. Read root instructions and, under `website/src/content/docs/docs/`,
`desktop-mobile-cli/desktop.mdx`, `contributing/development-setup.mdx`,
`contributing/coding-standards.mdx` and `contributing/testing.mdx` before changing
the boundary.

The production app is app-only. It never bundles, starts, supervises or stops a
local daemon. Preserve connections to separately installed local/remote Node
daemons and remote SSH deployment. Closing the app must leave those servers alone.

Keep the renderer sandboxed and context isolated. Expose validated native
capabilities through `window.froggDesktop`; restrict IPC to trusted app frames.
Use the 0.6 Frogg namespace and coordinate client/server upgrades when changing it.

Run focused behavioral tests, affected typechecks and the real app-only renderer
smoke. Test shutdown/relaunch and transport cancellation with resources owned by
the test. Treat Windows, macOS and Linux as first-class; record installer, signing,
voice and updater device acceptance separately from build success. Keep generated
outputs and synchronized versions under their documented scripts.

Inactive native-shell and Rust-backend reference sources are not production work
areas. Do not revive their migration plans or add them to release builds.

User-visible desktop changes (connections, SSH deploy, updates, installers, deep links)
update `desktop-mobile-cli/desktop.mdx` and its screenshots in the same change; see the
`frogg-docs` skill.
